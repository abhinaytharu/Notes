# Advanced Problems on Letter Selections & Arrangements

These are **challenging problems** involving combinations and
permutations with repeated letters. Try solving them before looking up
hints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Multilevel Selection & Arrangement

From the word **PROBABILITY**, how many 5-letter words can be formed
such that **no two identical letters are adjacent**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Conditional Selections

From the word **MISSISSIPPI**, how many 4-letter selections can be made
such that **at least one letter repeats**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Grouped Arrangement

From the letters of **BOOKKEEPER**, how many 5-letter arrangements can
be formed if **all vowels must be together**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Minimum & Maximum Frequency Constraints

From the word **ASSESSMENT**, how many 4-letter arrangements can be
formed containing **at most two S's**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Permutations with Restrictions

How many 6-letter arrangements of **BALLOON** are possible if **no L
appears at the end**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Combination of Selection + Positioning

From the word **PARALLEL**, how many 4-letter selections can be made and
arranged such that **all selected letters are different** and **the
arrangement starts with a consonant**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Try solving them systematically --- break into cases, account for
repeated letters, and watch for overcounting.*
